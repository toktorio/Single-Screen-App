A single screen app that displays an about page design of a fictional small business.

*This app is created as the first project of [Android Basics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) program at Udacity.*

### Features
- View a simple and stunning design of an about page.
- Design support for both portrait and landscape orientation.
- Perform a phone call, send an email, or view locations on Google Maps by clicking the contact info links.

### What I have learned from this project
- Creating user interface for Android apps using XML on Android Studio.
- Using ViewGroups to nest elements in order to create complex user interface.
- Sending implicit intents to start an activity in another app using [Common Intents](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html).
- Designing user interface for both portrait and landscape orientation.
